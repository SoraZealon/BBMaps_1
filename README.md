 
	If you've come to this github, then you're looking for Bad Business maps to play around in.
Just a few details I should say; I'm terrible at finishing my maps, but feel free to play them anyway.
 
All maps are used on Bad Business in Roblox. (https://www.roblox.com/games/3233893879/)
 
Steps on using a map in your Private Server;
	1: Select a File, and copy the RAW url.
	2: Open your Bad Business VIP server, press f6 and type "admin_importmap [Insert URL here]".
	3: If the map doesn't work, then it was an error on my end, or the importmap command broke.
	3: Press f6 again and type "admin_setmap custom_[Mapname]", and you're all good to go. (Map name will show in console once imported.)

Also, ignore the test file. That's usually where I test a new map or update to an existing map.
